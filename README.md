# Instagram Image Replicator

## Project Timeline : April 2017 - July 2017

## About the Platform : The platform uses Ghost Web Driver to spawn a virtual session of Chrome Web Browser to provide as host as a virtual API interface to user's Instagram account. The virtual API interface provides the metadata for the Instagram Profile including Image Storage on Instagram's Content Delivery Network. 

## Future Posibilities : Scaling up the platform to handle multiple user profiles. The performance can be improved using Multi Threading and Multi Core Processing.

### This could be considered as a vulnerability to the Instagram Web Platform as even when an image is delted from Instagram, it still exists on the Instagram CDN. Any such deleted can be recovered using the platform. The provided vulnerability has been reported to Instagram.
